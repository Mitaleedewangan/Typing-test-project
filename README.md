Developed a Java-based typing test application designed to evaluate typing speed and accuracy.

Key features include:

Mode Selection: Allows users to choose from three difficulty levels—Normal, Medium, and Hard—to tailor the typing test to their skill level.   
Random Word Selection: Selects 10 unique words randomly from a predefined list, ensuring a diverse and engaging typing challenge.
Real-Time Typing Assessment: Measures typing speed in words per minute (WPM) by comparing user input against the displayed words and calculating the time taken.
User Interface Enhancements: Utilizes ANSI escape codes to modify terminal text and background colors for a visually appealing experience.
Input Validation: Implements robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and ensure a smooth user experience.
Performance Metrics: Provides detailed feedback including words per minute, total words typed, and a list of typed words to help users track their performance.

This project demonstrates proficiency in Java programming, user input handling, randomization algorithms, and terminal-based user interface design.
